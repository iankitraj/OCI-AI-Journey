## ðŸ§© Supervised Learning â€“ Classification

### What is Classification?

Classification is a type of Supervised Learning where the output is **categorical (class labels)**.  
It assigns input data into predefined categories.

### Types of Classification

- Binary Classification â†’ 2 categories (Yes/No, Spam/Not Spam)
- Multi-class Classification â†’ More than 2 categories (Cat/Dog/Car)
- Multi-label Classification â†’ One sample can belong to multiple categories (Movie: Action + Comedy)

### Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Neural Networks

### Classification Use Cases

- Spam detection (Email: Spam / Not Spam)
- Disease detection (Patient: Positive / Negative)
- Image recognition (Cat / Dog / Car)
- Sentiment analysis (Positive / Negative)
- Credit scoring (Good / Bad borrower)

## ðŸ“Š Supervised Learning â€“ Regression

### What is Regression?

Regression is a type of Supervised Learning where the output is **continuous (numeric values)**.  
It predicts numerical outcomes based on input data.

### Types of Regression

- Linear Regression â†’ Predict using straight-line relationship
- Multiple Linear Regression â†’ Prediction using multiple input variables
- Polynomial Regression â†’ Prediction using curved (non-linear) relationships
- Logistic Regression â†’ (Technically classification but often grouped)

### Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree / Random Forest Regressor

### Regression Use Cases

- House price prediction (based on area, location, rooms)
- Stock price prediction (future values)
- Weather forecasting (temperature, rainfall)
- Sales forecasting (future demand)
- Salary prediction (based on experience, skills)
